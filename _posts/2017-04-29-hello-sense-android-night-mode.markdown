Night Mode has always been a highly anticipated feature for users of the Sense app. It required deep collaboration with the product and design teams in order to fully immerse the user with night mode throughout all existing parts of the app. The ultimate goal was to allow the users to navigate the app without straining their eyes after dark. Along the way, I documented the challenges we faced on Android to make night mode a success that is now the dominant theme chosen by over 80% of users! Hope you find my article useful when planning your own implementation for night mode with Android.
